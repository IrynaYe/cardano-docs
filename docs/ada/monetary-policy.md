# Cardano SL Monetary Policy

During the Sale period, up to 25,016,796,935 ADA Vouchers will be sold. After the Sales period ends, an amount equal to 20% of the Ada Vouchers sold during the Sale period, or, assuming all Ada Vouchers are sold, 5,003,359,387 ADA Vouchers, will be generated and distributed to three entities of the Cardano ecosystem that are part of the Technical, Business Development and Expansion Pool: IOHK, CGG and the Cardano Foundation. The total amount of Ada available at Launch will therefore be equal to 30,020,156,322 ADA.

Because there will never be more than 45,000,000,000 ADA, an additional 14,979,843,678 ADA (approximately 33% of the total amount of Ada to ever exist) will be issued gradually for the operation of the Protocol. The rate of issuance of Ada will be the following:

- 2,000 ADA per block for the initial 3,744,961 blocks,
- 1,000 ADA per block for the subsequent 3,744,961 blocks,
- 500 ADA per block for the subsequent 3,744,961 blocks,
- and so on and so forth, in such a way that the Ada per block will be halved every 3,744,961 blocks.

Given that there will be approximately 3 new blocks per minute, 99.95% of the additional 14,979,843,678 ADA necessary to reach the 45,000,000,000 ADA will be issued in approximately 24 years.

Of the Ada that will be issued per block, after Cardano SL launches,

- 25% of it will be directed to a Cardano Treasury Address, from which developers and ecosystem contributors can request the funding of their projects, and the stakeholders of the system would vote to approve or reject their proposals.

- 75% of it will be given to the protocol participants as a block reward. Given the security guarantees that Ouroboros, Cardanoâ€™s Proof-Of-Stake consensus algorithm requires, payouts will not be made at every block but at every a series of blocks.
