# Addresses in Cardano SL

To send and receive value, Addresses are used in virtually any cryptocurrency.

## How Does an Address Look Like?

In Cardano, we adopt Bitcoin way of encoding the address. It's called
“Base 58” because it uses 58-symbol alphabet to encode data. Here is the
alphabet we are using
`123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz`. Notably,
it avoids both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look
ambiguous when printed. It is therefore designed for human users who
manually enter the data, copying from some visual source, but also
allows easy copy and paste because a double-click will usually select
the whole string. We also adopt a way to make sure that an address is
entered correctly by appending a 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Code checksum
(CRC32) to the end of the part of the address which encodes public key
or script hash. This way, full address is generated by the following
rule, where `<>` is a concatenation operator:
`toBase58(addr<>crc32(addr))`.

An example of a valid address is
