# Navigating in Daedalus User Interface

[//]: # (<2017-01-13>)

Daedalus, the wallet of Cardano SL offers a multitude of functions, that
are easy and intuitive to use. Menu animations flow well and have a
zero-distraction mode. UI is minimalistic, color scheme is neutral. The
structure is concise and easy to follow. We've built Daedalus for your
convenience, prioritizing user experience and intuitive design. Current
feature set is minimalistic, most importantly it consists of options to

 + Check your balance
 + Make transactions
 + Create custom "wallets" tailored for your needs
 + Set up identity

Many more features are coming soon, so stay tuned for the update
changelogs and changes to this documentation!

## Layout

The general layout of the UI gives room to split into left, middle and
right section, excluding the header, footer and margins used for
composition. When referred to in the document, the left side refers to
_the menu_, middle refers to _main contents_ of page in question, right
holds _information and extra options_.

## Wallet

Denoted with a simple icon that represents a physical wallet.
Highlighted upon hovering. Each sub-menu contains information about b in
ada corresponding to each wallet; an option to send  and receive money
(highlighted upon hovering). Each wallet shows transaction history,
chronologically ordered.
